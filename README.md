# AR Drum Set

![](Demo/ARDemo1.gif.gif)

A Drum Set developed in Augmented Reality. The project was developed using the Vuforia Engine in Unity. I worked with a designer under a 1.5 week deadline to develop this virtual drum that allows users to record and save their own drum tracks.

A lot of the code for the Unity project has been removed to reduce storage space on Github. For access to the entire Unity project or an APK of the project, please contact me for a Drive link.
